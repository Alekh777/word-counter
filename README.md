# word-counter
A simple word counter to count the number of words/characters.
It works for cases listed below:
  i)  More than one space character in between words. e.g.- "this is an     example."
  ii) Works for spaces after the last word. e.g.- "this is an example    "
  
Sadly it doesn't work for strings starting with one or more than one space. e.g.- "  This is an example". Will definitely fix this issue in the future.
