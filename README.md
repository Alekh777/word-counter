# word-counter
A simple word counter to count the number of words/characters.
It works for cases listed below:
  i)  More than one space character in between words. e.g.- "this is an     example."
  ii) Works for spaces after the last word. e.g.- "this is an example    "
  iii) If there are spaces at the starting of the string, this can also be handled quite easily. e.g. - "    this is and example"
